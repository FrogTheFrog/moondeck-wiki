# Huh? Where am I?

You've in the MoonDeck wiki, congrats!

# What's next?

* If you're setting up Buddy, follow the [Buddy installation guide](./Buddy-installation-guide.md).
* If you have some issues with the plugin:
  * check the [Troubleshooting](./Troubleshooting.md) page, maybe someone else had similar issue already;
  * enable debug logs, maybe it's something obvious (check the [Buddy configuration](./Buddy-configuration.md) page on how to do it);
  * try to reach out on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/U88fbeHyzt);
  * Open a new issue.

# I want to extend this wiki!

In that case go to [moondeck-wiki](https://github.com/FrogTheFrog/moondeck-wiki) repo and create a pull-request!
